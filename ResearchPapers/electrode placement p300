In the studies done to determine optimal electrode placement for the P300 speller, it was determined that
EEG signals are measured best by electrodes covering the parietal and occipital lobes 



In a study, Batch Gibbs sampling used to find samples of distribution of electrodes best classifying EEG input 

-results showed that only using 4 electrodes (posterior) was enough to be effective
    -using 5 is better but not by much , etc
-in summary, the study shows that the no of electrodes used can be reduced without significantly affecting system performance 
-there is essentially a trade off between accuracy (increasing no of electrodes used) and improvement of set up time and reducing
 computational requirements for processing
 
 
 We will probably be using the max no of electrodes (8) 
 
 Some placement examples that have been used before are: 
 * refer to standard 10-20 EEG placement
 
 { PO8, PO7, POz, Oz, CPz }
 { C3, Cz, C4, P3, Pz, P4, O1, O2}
 
 and many other combinations around thE P, C, PO regions
