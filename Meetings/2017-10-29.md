- Muse 2016 refactoring, being preliminary testing
### Done:
- basic understanding of sampling procedure (from P300 paper) 

## Binary Classification:
### TODO:
- Collect labelled data
- Test pre-processing algorithm and FFT
- If working, collect more data to verify frequency bin of higher differential

- Collected labelled data (need to fix un-ordered samples and empty column)
- Testsed pre-processing and parsing

## Multi-class:
### TODO:
- Go through important terms and concepts in "Discriminating hand gesture motor imagery tasks using cortical current density estimation"
### Done:
- 

## Soft-Eng:
### TODO:
- Go through openBCI and Node.js code and compare for optimizations
- Read more on Cython
- Go through "Brain-computer interface (BCI) operation: optimizing information transfer rates" (eventually)
### Done:
