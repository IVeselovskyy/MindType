# Monday July 31 2017:
## Attendees:
- Saya, Alaa, Rustem, Abdo, Musa

## Goals:
- Figure out applying fft to get frequency bins
- Average rest_data values
- Compare samples with rest to the highest differential
- Decide on as threshould to get control signal

## Meeting notes:
- Musa: Implemented FFT and got frequency bins amplitudes, needs to get meaningful toy data to test on it.
- Rusty and Alaa: implemented the function to average rest data values across all rest samples
