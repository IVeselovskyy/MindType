# Preparation:

* all of us: read through 0MQ (if not done already)
* all of us: read over, UNDERSTAND "Comparison of Classification Methods for P300 Brain-Computer Interface on Disabled Subjects" + MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES mentioned!!!
   * https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175727/
      * main paper
   * https://med.nyu.edu/chibi/sites/default/files/chibi/Final.pdf
      * Gentle Introduction to SVMs
   * For beginners in machine learning:
      * http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/
         * Visual Intro to Random Forests
      * https://jalammar.github.io/visual-interactive-guide-basics-neural-networks/
         * A Visual and Interactive Guide to the Basics of Neural Networks
   * (Wiki each of the methods mentioned to understand better)
* Alisa: make sure that Clubhouse room is booked
* Abdel, Riley: continue reading over PyQt to understand it better
  * especially Listeners
* Rustem, Sayan: read over multithreading, advanced PyZMQ
  * https://pymotw.com/2/threading/
