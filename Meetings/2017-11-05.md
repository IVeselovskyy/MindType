## P300:
### TODO:
- generate data to recognize P300
    - create simple binary oddball paradigm program (Pratham)
    - signal processing research: find and make notes on paper (Jeremy/Pratham)
        - familiarize with Fourier transforms (Jeremy)
        - familiarize with different filter techniques (Jeremy/Pratham)
### Done:
- Notes on P300 paper experimental process
- Test recording on muse EEG data

## Binary Classification:
### TODO:

### Done:


## Multi-class:
### Meeting:
    - so far:
        - reading through "Cortical Current Density" paper
        - issues:
            - disturbance manually taken out
                - Ramin: anomaly detection?
            - 8 electrodes vs 64 for source localization
                - Ramin: use of pure ML approach perhaps?
                - Sayan: or use of non-uniform electrode density?
            - gestures done in pairs repetitively during training / testing
                - how to differentiate between gesture pair A - B - A vs A - rest - A vs A - rest - B ?
