# May 28, 2017: Meeting Notes

# Preparation:

* EEG Speller Validation Study: (See ./ResearchPapers/Motor Imagery EEG Speller--Validation.docx)
    * just skim the papers mentioned here; we'll look at these in detail later
* "Design, implementation and evaluation of a real-time P300-based Brain-Computer Interface system"  (See ./ResearchPapers)
* "Comparison of Classification Methods for P300 Brain-Computer Interface on Disabled Subjects" : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175727/

# Agenda (5:00--6:00pm)
### Admin
* 3 meetings too many? Too little?
* what days are good for?
### Development process
* Agile approach
    * each iteration: 3 weeks
        * 2 weeks dev; 1 week integration testing
    * increase complexity of product each iteration

### Milestones
* P300 speller
* 2-gesture motor imagery (from WallEEG) + speller
* implementation of 4-gesture motor imagery per hand + speller
* improvements

### Timeline
May 28--June 19: P300 speller

June 19--July 10:
2-gesture motor imagery

July 10--July 31:
4-gesture motor imagery + speller

# Dev Progress (6:00pm--8:00pm)

## Progress:
* init src repo, Conda envs
* reading over ZeroMQ, PyQt
    * install: https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq/wiki/Building-and-Installing-PyZMQ
    * docs: http://learning-0mq-with-pyzmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyzmq/basics.html

## Design Considerations
* Languages:
    * Python and Android
* OpenBCI only supports Bluetooth to laptop!
    * need to rewrite firmware
    * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H03FZHyrSAI (translated by Abdel)
* ZeroMQ:
    * publish subscribe pattern
        * UDP socket
            * because it's faster (even though TCP is more secure)

## Project 'Skillz'
This will help us assign tasks to each other. We'll use GitHub Issues as main task manager.

# Next Meeting: Wed May 31
* all of us: read through 0MQ
* Riley, Abdel: read about PyQt, and TouchUI
    * https://github.com/harbaum/TouchUI
* Rustem: look at new OpenBCI code:
    https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_Python
* Sayan: port VitReous code over to OpenBCI
* Alisa: find P300 data
