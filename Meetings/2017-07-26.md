# July 24, 2017

## Attendees:
- Sayan, Abdel, Musa, Alaa

## Meeting Notes:
- tasks that have to be done
    - Phase 1
        - (Hisham needs some concrete steps)
        - implement real-time alg
            - test, iterate
    - Phase 2
        - done:
            - start coding C3, C4 frequencies (power spectral analysis)
        - need to do:
            - start collecting data
                - for now: generate toy data
                    - to ensure alg has no bugs
                - next: get real data
                    - verify data:
                        - concentration/calmness
                        - test motor functionality with mu wave band
                    - train on frequency in C3/C4
                    - implement controller based on this paradigm, test
    - Phase 3
        - done:
            - read, understood paper
        - to do:
            - reread paper once more
            - pseudocode for alg
            - design experiment, validation paradigm
    - Neurotech Library
        - done:
            - multithreading paradimg that is functional
        - to do:
            - make data collection paradigm
            - optimize everything
                - rewrite some of internals of bci library
            - (later) move to messaging queue

## Goals:
- Sayan, Abdel: implement data collection functionality
- Rusty, Musa, Alaa: finish training algorithm, generate toy data
